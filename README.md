# ABLXtag
Group of functions we use to analyze Microwave Telemetry X-tags. This is adapted from the analyzepsat package, updated to run in R>2.15

First stab, created 1_14_2016. Current version only applies to recovered tags, those with downloaded high resolution archived data. This code is destined for a package, but still working on it. Use with caution. Will post example code shortly.
